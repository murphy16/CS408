Problem Statement
------------------
There is a massive amount of textual data being generated every minute in the world. With the ever increasing amount of text, numerous programs have arisen to allow users to efficiently interact with and modify text. It is important for anyone seeking a job in today’s market to have at least a novice level of proficiency using the most basic text manipulation tools. Parents can ensure that their children start off with an edge on the competition by teaching them the basics of text manipulation at an early age. A new generation of children need to learn how to use the myriad of functions available to them in modern word processing applications or risk becoming irrelevant in today’s workforce. Parents need a tool that will allow their children to learn the basics of text manipulation. This tool needs to present the various functionalities of text manipulation to children in a simple manner that allows them to learn the effect each feature on text.
