Problem Statement
------------------
There is a vast amount of textual data stored on the internet; news columnists, bloggers, and social media gurus alike need a way to efficiently and effectively combine this data from multiple sources in order to confirm the validity of a rumor. Without the combination of data from multiple sources and the scaling (of such sources) for common keywords, these writers could potentially risk losing credibility by promoting false information in his or her articles or posts. In order to avoid sacrificing their careers, they need a tool which will allow them to search multiple websites for keywords. This tool must also crawl through websites associated with entered key words to find common verbiage about the topic.

Project Objectives
------------------
1. User Interface
	* Create a foolproof user experience
2. Quick Search
	* Provide "Quick Search" functionality to scrape/check various media resources (based on user's terms)
3. Recent News
	* Allow users instant access to recent news (based upon user's terms)
4. Fact Checking
	* Aid users in confirming or denying circulating rumors

Bloggers, columnists, social media enthusiasts, website developers, and journalists.

Project Deliverables
------------------
The creation of a Java application which allows users to input a keyword associated with a topic they would like to receive information about, and then displays specific common text items found on multiple websites using a web crawler.
