Problem Statement
------------------
With vast quanties of textual data stored on the internet, news columnists, bloggers, and social media gurus alike need a way to succinctly and effectively combine data from multiple websites in order to check the validity of a rumor. Without the combination of data from multiple sources and the scaling of those sources for common keywords, these writers could potentially risk losing their credibility by promoting false information in their articles or posts. In order to avoid sacrificing their careers, they need a tool which will allow them to search multiple websites for keywords; this tool must also crawl through website associated with those key words to find common verbiage about the topic.

Project Objectives
------------------
1. Create an easy-to-understand/easy-to-use user interface
2. Allow users to quickly search a variety of sources (based on their terms)
3. Allow users to have instant access to the latest news (based on their terms)
4. Aid users in confirming/denying circulating rumors

Stakeholders
------------------
Bloggers, columnists, social media enthusiasts, website developers, and journalists

Project Deliverables
------------------
The creation of a JAVA GUI application which allows users to input a keyword associated with a topic they would like to receive information about, and then displays specific common text items found on multiple websites using a webcrawler.
